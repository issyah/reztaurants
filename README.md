# reztaurants
This application will be available cross-platform both iOS and android. This application allows users to order food and reserve a spot in restaurants. The user can place an order, make reservation, and make payment online where the restaurant would then proceed make the orders. The defining features that our application has is that users can be geolocated, restaurants will be able to view where users are at and get a notification when the users are nearby. There is also no application in the Singapore market where users can pre-order their food, make payment for dining in.
